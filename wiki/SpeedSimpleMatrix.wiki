#summary SimpleMatrix runtime performance study.
= Introduction =
To provide a better understanding of the performance difference between SimpleMatrix and using the operations interface a study was performed.  The study was composed of running several benchmarks across different operations and matrix sizes using [http://code.google.com/p/java-matrix-benchm JMatBench].  Only operations were tested that had a direct equivalent in the two interfaces.

In general the more computationally intensive an operation is the less noticable the difference is in performance.  EJML is significantly slower for element-wise operations such as add and scale.  There is an insignificant performance difference for more expensive operations such as multiplication and SVD on larger matrices and only a small performance hit on small matrices.
