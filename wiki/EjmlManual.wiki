= Introduction =

EJML is a linear algebra library for Java.  The following is a manual that describes how to use it.  There are three ways to program in EJML; simple, operator, and algorithm. These essentially flow from easy to program, but less efficient, to more difficult to program but more efficient.

Examples:
 # [KalmanFilterExamples Kalman Filter].
 # [LevenbergMarquardtExample Levenberg-Marquardt]
 # RANSAC Line Fitting
 # Solving Linear Systems
 # Matrix Decompositions
