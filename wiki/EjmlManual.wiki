= Introduction =

EJML is a linear algebra library for Java.  The following is a manual that describes how to use it.  There are three ways to program in EJML; simple, operator, and algorithm. These essentially flow from easy to program, but less efficient, to more difficult to program but more efficient.

Example Code:
 # [KalmanFilterExamples Kalman Filter].
    * Example of using simple, operator, and algorithm interfaces.
 # [LevenbergMarquardtExample Levenberg-Marquardt]
    * Effective matrix reshaping.
    * General example.
 # [PolynomialFitExample Polynomial Fitting]
    * Creating a linear solver.
    * Using an adjustable solver.

Tutorial:
 # Solving Linear Systems
 # Matrix Decompositions

Detailed JavaDoc documentation is provided in almost all the classes.  See the [home_page http://code.google.com/p/efficient-java-matrix-library/w/edit/EjmlManual] for a link to the latest JavaDoc.


= Building =

EJML can be easily compiled using any IDE (e.g. Eclipse or Intellij) or by using the provided ant scripts.  To build using ant first make sure ant is installed.  Once ant is installed the project can be build by going into the commandline, changing into the project's main directory, and typing "ant".  In Linux or Windows you should see some output that looks like this:
{{{
pja@silent:~/projects/java/ejml$ ant
Buildfile: build.xml

clean:
   [delete] Deleting directory /home/pja/projects/java/ejml/build

compile:
    [mkdir] Created dir: /home/pja/projects/java/ejml/build/classes
    [javac] Compiling 94 source files to /home/pja/projects/java/ejml/build/classes

jar:
    [mkdir] Created dir: /home/pja/projects/java/ejml/build/jar
      [jar] Building jar: /home/pja/projects/java/ejml/build/jar/EJML.jar

main:

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 3 seconds
}}}

Once it has been built the jar can be moved from "build/jar/EJML.jar" to a convenient location in your own project.
