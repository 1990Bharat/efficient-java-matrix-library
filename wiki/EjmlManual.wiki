EJML is a linear algebra library for Java.  The following is a manual that describes how to use it.  There are three ways to program in EJML; simple, operation, and algorithm. These essentially flow from easy to program, but less efficient, to more difficult to program but more efficient.

Examples:
 # Kalman Filter
 # Levenberg-Marquardt
 # Solving Linear Systems
