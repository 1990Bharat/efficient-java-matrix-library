#summary Introduction to EJML

= Introduction =

*Efficient Java Matrix Library* (EJML) is a linear algebra library for manipulating dense matrices. Its design goals are; 1) to be as computationally efficient as possible for both small and large matrices, and 2) to be accessible to both novices and experts.  It is 100% Java with no native code required.

EJML has three distinct ways to interact with it.  This allows a programmer to choose between simplicity and efficiency.  1) A simplified interface that allows a more object oriented way of programming.  2) Letting EJML select the best algorithm to use.  3) Directly calling specialized algorithms.  

For operations on small matrices EJML was found to be the fastest java matrix library by a large margin.  For operations on large matrices EJML is in general one of the faster libraries.  This performance was obtained by having minimal overhead, several specialized implementations of the same operation, and good memory management.  Performance was benchmarked using JMatrixBenchmark, see below for a link to the results.
