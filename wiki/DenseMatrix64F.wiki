#summary Overview of DenseMatrix64F

= Introduction =

DenseMatrix64F is the most common basic matrix format in EJML.  It provides basic operators for accessing elements within a matrix and well as its size and shape.  More complex functions for manipulating the matrix have been put in CommonOps and SpecializedOps as wekk as several other classes.  This was done to simplify the design and avoid having a single monolithic difficult to understand class.  Internally it stores the matrix in a single array using a row-major format.  

The operator interface in EJML works with DenseMatrix64F and is designed to enable highly efficient code to be written.  An easier to use but more restrictive interface is provided with SimpleMatrix.
